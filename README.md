# Car-Sale-Prediction
This is a part of my college project related to typical machine learning concepts of regression.
The data was scraped from several websites in Czech Republic and Germany over a period of more than a year. To access the dataset please click on this - https://www.kaggle.com/mirosval/personal-cars-classifieds
I performed data pre-processing of roughly 3.5 million rows and exploratory data analysis to check the distribution of data in each column.
Later, I implemented various regression algorithms to find out how the factors affect the price of the used car and the resale value.
Finally, determined the optimal algorithm suited for this data which has the highest R^2 value as deciding parameter.
